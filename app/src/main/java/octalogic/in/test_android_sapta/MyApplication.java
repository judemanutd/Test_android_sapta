    // PLEASE READ ALL POINTS BEFORE STARTING

    //TODO: create a floating action button called fab with id fab (the app should only contain a single floating action button)

    //TODO: modify and use the existing code to display 2 tabs in the MainActivity; 1 tab should have a title First, the other should have a title Second

    //TODO: modify and use the existing code to display a recycler view in each tab

    //TODO: each recycler view should display an item of type BasicImageHolder ( the model class and xml for the item is present in the project )

    //TODO: for each item in a row in the recycler view, the text displayed should be in italics and have a size of 18

    //TODO: when the user taps on the floating action button, there should be 1 row added to each recycler view
    // when the user taps the fab for the first time the data added to both recycler views should be `row 1`, the second time the user taps,
    // the data inserted in both should be `row 2`. The data at this point should look like the table below

    /*
            |    First      |     Second    |
            | ------------- | ------------- |
            |     Row 1     |     Row 1     |
            |     Row 2     |     Row 2     |

     */

    //TODO: when the user taps anywhere on the row in the recycler view then it should only delete a row from the other recycler view
    // example if there are 5 rows in First Tab & 5 rows in Second tab and the user taps on a row in the Second Tab
    // then the result will be that First Tab will still have 5 rows but the Second Tab will now have 4 rows.

    // DO NOT ADD ANY THIRD PARTY DEPENDENCIES TO THE EXISTING PROJECT.
